                The goal of Mario Memory is to match pairs of cards with the same Mario characters until all cards are successfully matched
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players must only flip over two cards at a time</li>
                <li>Remember the location of cards that have been flipped over to help find matching pairs</li>
                <li>Players must use their memory and concentration skills to recall the location of cards and match them accordingly</li>
                <li>The game ends when all pairs of cards have been matched or when the time runs out, you have one minute</li>
